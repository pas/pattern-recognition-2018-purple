# Multilayer Perceptron Draft Tensorflow

Author: Silas

## How to use
- create new virtual environment, install dependencies (requirements.txt to follow)
- create a new empty folder MNIST_data (will change soon, will need to provide data from assignment)
- run multilayer_perceptron.py from virtualenv, will train and evaluate the model with a fixed set of hyperparameters
